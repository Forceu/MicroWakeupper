 * microWakeupperESP
 * 
 * Example code for "How to integrate the microWakeupper board into your own projects?"
 * This example is specially for the ESP8266 (basically the ESP32 should work too).
 * 
 * The ESP supports different DeepSleep modes to reduce power consumption to a minimum.
 * For more information check this doc: 
 * 
 *  https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/9b-esp8266-low_power_solutions_en_0.pdf
 *  
 * If you google for "ESP deep sleep" there alredy some really cool examples/projects available, 
 * for example: 
 *  https://www.losant.com/blog/making-the-esp8266-low-powered-with-deep-sleep
 *  
 * The microWakeupper board is NOT necessary, if the ESP just has to wakeup based on 
 * a sleep timer - don't forget to connect the pins GPIO16 and RST.
 * BUT if you want to wakeup (additionally) through an external event (e.g. a switch, button or PIR-sensor)
 * the microWakeupper makes your life much easier!
 * 
 * 
 * How to connect the microWakupper to your ESP?
 *  (Check also the backside notes directly on the board ;-)
 *  
 *  :: ESP :::        ::: microWakeupper :::
 *  VCC (3.3)   <-->  VCC   (mandatory)
 *  GND         <-->  GND   (mandatory)
 *  RST         <-->  RST   (mandatroy)
 *  GPIO16      <-->  G16   (optional)
 *      Not necessary if you don't use a sleep timer, or GPIO16 is already connect to RST.
 *  OUTPUT      <-->  DIS   (optional)
 *      Just set DIS (disable pin) to HIGH, if you want to disable the microWakeupper. 
 *      This prevents further resets as long as your code is running (until going to sleep again).
 *  INPUT       <-->  STA   (optional)
 *      This pin is HIGH, if the microWakeupper was triggered within the last 2-3 seconds.
 * 
 *

 * This example code is in the public domain.
